There is no need to purchase the book to participate in these workshops, but if you would like it, you can find it here: [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6487349-the-art-of-unit-testing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6487349-the-art-of-unit-testing)

There is also a 3rd edition due to come out later this year, with the examples giving in JS.

The examples given in the book are in C#, and I'll use that as well when we need some concrete code examples, but the principals apply to any language you are coding in. The code examples from the book are freely available on Github.
