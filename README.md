There is no need to purchase the book to participate in these workshops, but if you would like it, you can find it here: [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6487349-the-art-of-unit-testing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6487349-the-art-of-unit-testing)

The examples given in the book are in C#, and I'll use that as well when we need some concrete code examples, but the principals apply to any language you are coding in.
